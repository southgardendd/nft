            Ukrainians will never forget the events of February 24, 2022. 
            All residents of Ukraine woke up at 5 AM local time. Someone from the explosion near, others from calls from parents and friends.
            On this day, Russia declared a "military operation", but in reality it is a war. On the first day, missile strikes were carried 
            out on military facilities in many cities in Ukraine.
            For several days, the Russian army tried to invade the cities. after unsuccessful attempts, rocket attacks began on civilian homes, schools and hospitals.

            Our NFT shows the horrors of war - the death of civilians, propaganda and censorship, intimidation and infringement of human rights.
            But the ultimate goal of every Ukrainian is the independence of the country and a peaceful sky overhead.

                On Feb. 24, Russian forces launch a devastating assault on Ukrainian territory — the largest such military operation in Europe since the end of World War II. Missiles rain down on Ukraine's cities and columns of Russian troops from neighboring Belarus and from Russian-held Crimea reportedly begin streaming into the countryside. Ukrainian forces reportedly try to hold back the Russian advance on several fronts.
