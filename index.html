            Ukrainians will never forget <b>24 February 2022</b>. On that day, people across the country woke up at 5 AM. Some because of explosions nearby, others because of calls from worried parents and friends. On that day, Russia declared a "military operation," which was a <b><u>WAR</u></b> in reality.
            First, russian army launched missile strikes on military objects all over Ukraine. After that, russian infantry and tanks brutally attacked major cities expecting to occupy them quickly and easily. But they were wrong.
            The Ukrainian army and volunteers were able to defend their cities, and then began a counter-attack that pushed russian forces back.
            Faced with fierce resistance from the Ukrainians, russian army retreated and started methodically destroying the infrastructure and communications of Ukrainian cities hoping to take them by siege.
            This still did not work and russian military began bombing homes, schools and hospitals, killing hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. Tens of thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes to avoid being killed by the bombs and bullets of the invaders. Because of the constant shelling by russian forces, a number of Ukrainian towns and villages are on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe.

            Our project aims to raise money to provide humanitarian assistance to Ukrainians who fled their homes after the attack on their homes by the Russian army.

            Our NFT shows the horrors of war - the death of civilians, propaganda and censorship, intimidation and infringement of human rights.
            But the ultimate goal of every Ukrainian is the independence of the country and a peaceful sky overhead.
