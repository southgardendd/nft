            Ukrainians will never forget <b>24 February 2022</b>. On that day, people across the country woke up at 5 AM. Some because of explosions nearby, others because of calls from worried parents and friends. On that day, Russia declared a "military operation," which was a <b class="red">WAR</b> in reality.
            First, russian army launched missile strikes on military objects all over Ukraine. After that, russian infantry and tanks brutally attacked major cities expecting to occupy them quickly and easily. But they were wrong.
            The Ukrainian army and volunteers were able to defend their cities, and then began a counter-attack that pushed russian forces back.
            Faced with fierce resistance from the Ukrainians, russian army retreated and started methodically destroying the infrastructure and communications of Ukrainian cities hoping to take them by siege.
            This still did not work and russian military began bombing homes, schools and hospitals, killing hundreds of Ukrainian civilians. Tens of thousands of people were forced to abandon their homes to avoid being killed by the bombs and bullets of the invaders. Because of the constant shelling by russian forces, a number of Ukrainian towns and villages are on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe.

        <p>
            Russia attacked Ukraine at 5 AM on Thursday after Putin announced a full-scale military operation, which was in reality a declaration of war.
            Russian army hit several Ukrainian cities with missiles, including the capital Kyiv, as Ukraine reported columns of troops moving across its borders into the eastern Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk regions, and landing by sea at the cities of Odesa and Mariupol in the south.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">February 25:</h5>
        <p>
            Russian forces press towards the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, as the United Nations says more than 50,000 people have fled the country since the start of russian invasion.

        <h5 class="contacts">February 26:</h5>

            The mayor of Kyiv imposes a curfew in the Ukrainian capital as russian troops advance towards the city. Poland says about 100,000 people have crossed into the country from Ukraine amid the fighting.

        <p>
            Russian troops press towards three Ukrainian cities: Kyiv, Kharkiv and Kherson. They appear to face stiff resistance that US officials say is slowing their advance. The Ukrainian defence ministry says it estimates russian losses at 4,500 men killed, 150 tanks and 700 armoured personnel carriers destroyed, and seven fighter jets and 26 helicopters downed.

            In a largely symbolic move, Ukraine applies to join EU.
            Russia and Ukraine hold a first round of ceasefire talks at the Belarusian border. They disband after five hours without an agreement.
            Russian army shelling pounds Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, home to 1.5 million people. Russian artillery bombards residential districts, killing at least 11 people, according to Ukrainian officials. Zeleknsyy says the russian plan is to terrorise the country’s civilian population.

        <h5 class="contacts">March 1:</h5>

            A 65km-long Russian convoy amasses on the outskirts of Kyiv. Pressure also increases on Kharkiv and Mariupol in the east, and Kherson in the south of the country. 
            A russian missile strikes the square in front of the Kharkiv administrative building, blowing off its roof and gutting it. Zelenskyy calls the attack “frank, undisguised terror”.
            Human Rights Watch reports that russians are using cluster bombs against civilians. Ukrainian officials also accuse Russia of targeting a television tower in Kyiv in an attack that killed five people.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 2:</h5>
        <p>
            Russian forces pounded Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, with airstrikes in a bid to break the will of the country’s resistance as Moscow’s offensive toward Kyiv stalled and Ukrainian officials said the invasion’s civilian death toll has reached 2,000.
            Kharkiv residents said the city of 1.4 million people suffered heavy bombardment for the third day in a row. However, the front line held and the city, located 30 miles from the Russian border, remained under firm Ukrainian control.
            Russia claims its forces have captured Kherson, in southern Ukraine. Local authorities deny the city has fallen, but say russian troops have encircled it.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 3:</h5>
        <p>
            Russian troops seized the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest in Europe. In a worrying development a part of the plant catches fire threatening a nuclear accident 10 times the size Chernobyl. The crisis is averted, but Russia retains control of the site.
            Ukrainian refugees hit 1 million and Russia has now launched more than 480 missiles targeting civilian areas and government infrastructure. Ukrainian resistance remains strong. Talks between Russia and Ukraine ended without a ceasefire but instead an agreement to allow civilians safe passage from besieged cities.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 4:</h5>
        <p>
            The United Nations offers to secure Ukraine’s nuclear sites, including Chernobyl which was the site of a 1986 nuclear disaster.
            Putin dismisses as fake reports that Russia is bombing Ukraine, where 47 people were killed in the city of Chernihiv, during an interview with Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz.
            Instead a third round of peace talks is planned as NATO formally rejects Zelenskyy’s request for a no-fly zone. The Black Sea port town of Mariupol announces it is without water and heating and the tally of those fleeing Ukraine tops 1.2 million.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 5:</h5>
        <p>
            Russia promises to allow a humanitarian corridor to allow residents of Mariupol to leave but it doesn’t last long. Later in the day with the city still under fire the evacuation is halted. The city of Chernihiv, 140km from Kyiv, is bombed with explosions lighting up the sky as russian troops continue to the capital.
            However Ukranian resistance remains fierce.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 6:</h5>
        <p>
            Violations of a ceasefire agreement prevented planned evacuations from the port city of Mariupol as Zelenskyy telephoned Biden to discuss financial aid and sanctions. Zelenskyy’s hopes for a ban on Russian oil imports were turned down with Biden fearful of forcing up consumer prices.
            Putin states that any nation backing a no-fly zone over Ukraine will be considered an enemy combatant raising fears of a wider war, possibly nuclear, if such a zone went ahead.  Around 1.5 million Ukrainians have now fled their country.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 7:</h5>
        <p>
            Russia shelled civilian targets and prevented people from escaping some cities under attack during the war’s 12th day, while Kyiv’s military held fast along several fronts ahead of planned cease-fire talks.
            Continuing campaigns to encircle Ukrainian cities Monday, russian forces conducted missile and rocket strikes on cities and military targets in the country’s north and south, disrupting plans to evacuate civilians via humanitarian corridors, Ukrainian officials said. 
            A russian strike hit a civilian evacuation point outside Kyiv, reportedly killing eight people, including two children, as they tried to flee their homes.
            Fears are mounting for civilians trapped in the cities of Mariupol, Volnovakha and Kyiv as the Russian onslaught continues.
        </p>
        <h5 class="contacts">March 8:</h5> 
        <p>
            One convoy of civilians was evacuated from the besieged northeastern city of Sumy, but renewed russian shelling forced the effort to be halted. Heavy fighting continued across the country, particularly in Mariupol, where evacuation efforts failed for the fourth day.
            Combat went on around the strategic town of Izyum, eastern Ukraine, where russian forces advanced as they attempted to encircle some of the country’s most hardened forces in the Donbas region. Ukraine continued to repel russian attempts to break into the southeastern port city of Mykolaiv, the gateway to Odessa.
            Two million people have fled Ukraine in the 13 days since the war began, the United Nations said, as the exodus picks up pace. That's about 4% of Ukraine's population, and at least half of the refugees are children.
